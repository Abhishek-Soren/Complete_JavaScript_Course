        <p>
            Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
            restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
            300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
        </p>

        <div class="task">
            <h2>Your tasks:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip'
                    for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement (If it's easier for you,
                    you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
                    operator!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final
                    value (bill + tip). Example: "The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total
                    value 316.25"
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="test-data">
            <h2>Test data:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="hints">
            <h2>Hints:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2</li>
                <li>Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
