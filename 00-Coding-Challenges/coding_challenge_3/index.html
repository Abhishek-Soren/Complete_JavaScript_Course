        <h2>Coding Challenge #3</h2>

        <p>
            There are two gymnastics teams, <strong>Dolphins</strong> and <strong>Koalas</strong>.
            They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins
            a trophy!
        </p>

        <div class="task">
            <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below</li>
                <li>
                    Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
                    and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for
                    that as well (draw means they have the same average score)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonus 1</strong>: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With
                    this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and
                    the same time a score of at least 100 points. <strong>Hint</strong>: Use a
                    logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonus 2</strong>: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only
                    happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or
                    equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
                </li>
            </ol>
