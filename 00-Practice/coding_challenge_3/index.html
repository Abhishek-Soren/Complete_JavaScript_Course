            <h1>Coding Challenge #3</h1>
            <p>
                There are two gymnastics teams, <em>Dolphins</em> and <em>Koalas</em>. They compete
                against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
            </p>

            <h2>Your tasks:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below</li>
                <li>
                    Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
                    and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for
                    that as well (draw means they have the same average score)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
                    team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
                    score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
                    score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ï¿½
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both
                    teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points.
                    Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Test data:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110</li>
                <li>Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123</li>
                <li>Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106</li>
            </ul>
